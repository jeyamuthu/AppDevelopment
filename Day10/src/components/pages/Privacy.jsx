            <p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information

              address, time zone, and some of the cookies

            <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>

            <p>- “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an
              anonymous unique identifier. </p>

            <p>-“Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address,
